# torch-memristor

Torch-memristor is a python package based on [Synaptogen](https://github.com/thennen/Synaptogen), which allows to run simulated memristor arrays with PyTorch. It includes code to aid with quantization aware training, as well as memristor-based drop-ins for neural network layers such as the "Linear" Module.
